Hi NAME,

We would love to include your proposal "PRESENTATION"  in the Scotland JS Conference programme for 2012.  Thanks for submitting!

Please can you confirm that you will be presenting, as soon as you can?  Then we can start getting our schedule together and letting delegates know about the talk.

We are sorry that we can not offer expenses for speaking.  If a company (your employer, for instance) is funding your attendance, we would be happy to put their logo up in a "Speaker Sponsor" section of the site.

If you have already bought a ticket for the conference, then we owe you a refund. Please let us know, and we will arrange that.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
---
Peter
